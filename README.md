# C-Palindrome
DSTI C programming project: Create a C program to check if given word is a palindrome or not, using dynamic allocations and stack.

# Code Specification:
	1/ Loop will occur until user explicitly exit the program with tapping "."
	2/ During the loop 2 questions will be asked to user:
		a/ Enter string to check if this is palindrome or not
		b/ Enter expected pattern, OK or NOK
	3/ For each string of characters entered by user, check will be performed and the return in the prompt the result if the check
	4/ Used loop is "do ... while", meaning undefined iteration until user explicitly exit the program
	5/ At the end a summary of all entered words will be printed in the prompt
	6/ And finally a CSV file will be genarated with the summary
	7/ Dynamic pointers with memory allocations in the heap will be used
